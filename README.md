# SearchEngine
A search engine that uses different data structures to scan files and rank the files in order of most hits. Users can search for keywords or whole sentences and the search engine ranks files based on most matches. Users also have the option to add files that are to be scanned

The same search engine has been implemented using three different data structures: Linked Lists, AVL Trees, and HashMaps
